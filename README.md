# Flying-Object-Classification
MPE Research Project
The project is divided into two parts, simulation data generation and preprocessing, and model design and training 
# Simulation

The simulation part of the code shows only one type of object, and other types of objects can be simulated by adjusting the parameters of the object. Preprocessing means converting the generated mat format file to npy file and doing the division of the training validation set test set.

# Model

The model designed for the project will be trained and evaluated with different datasets and comparisons will be made, and ablation experiments can be done on different modules of the model to verify module validity
